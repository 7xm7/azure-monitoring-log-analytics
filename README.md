# üìä Azure Monitoring & Log Analytics

## üéØ Objective
This lab demonstrates how to **monitor and analyze infrastructure performance** in Microsoft Azure using **Log Analytics, Azure Monitor, and Alerts**.  
The goal was to create a centralized monitoring system capable of collecting metrics, visualizing real time data, and triggering alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup
**Resource Group:** `Lab3-MonitorRG`  
**Region:** `West Europe`  
**Main Resources:**
- Virtual Machine (connected via Azure Monitor Agent)  
- Log Analytics Workspace (`lab3-logworkspace`)  
- Data Collection Rule  
- Azure Monitor Alerts  
- Custom Dashboard for visualization

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Visualization
Built a custom **Azure Monitor Dashboard** to visualize:
- CPU percentage (Average)  
- Memory usage  
- Heartbeat frequency
